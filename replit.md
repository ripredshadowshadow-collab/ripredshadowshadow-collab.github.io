# Interactive Grid Game

## Overview
A dynamic HTML5 game application featuring multiple mini-games with online multiplayer support:
- **Grid Avoidance Game**: Navigate through a grid-based racing game avoiding obstacles
- **CPS Tester**: Test your clicks-per-second performance
- **Reaction Tester**: Measure your reaction time
- **Online Mode**: Race against other players in real-time multiplayer lobbies (up to 6 players)

## Project Structure
```
.
├── index.html           # Main HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
├── server.py           # FastAPI server with WebSocket support for multiplayer
├── pyproject.toml      # Python dependencies (FastAPI, uvicorn, websockets)
└── .gitignore         # Git ignore file for Python and Replit files
```

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (CDN), Vanilla JavaScript, WebSocket Client
- **Backend**: FastAPI with WebSocket support (Python 3.11)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket for lobby management and race synchronization
- **Hosting**: Replit (0.0.0.0:5000)

## Development Setup
The project uses FastAPI with WebSocket support:
- Server binds to `0.0.0.0:5000` for Replit compatibility
- WebSocket endpoint at `/ws` for real-time multiplayer communication
- Cache-Control headers prevent caching issues during development
- Auto-restart enabled via workflow
- Dependencies managed via `uv` and `pyproject.toml`
- Python 3.11 with FastAPI, Uvicorn, and WebSockets installed

## Running Locally
```bash
python3 server.py
```
The application will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:5000/`

## Deployment
Configured for Replit Autoscale deployment:
- Deployment Target: Autoscale (for stateless web apps with WebSocket support)
- Run Command: `python3 server.py`
- Port: 5000
- Ready to publish: Click the "Publish" button in Replit to deploy

## Features
- Fully responsive mobile and desktop design
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Multiple game modes with different difficulty levels
- Score tracking and performance metrics
- Car selection system with vehicle specifications

## Mobile Controls (Grid Game)
The Grid Game features dedicated mobile touch controls that appear on mobile devices:
- **W Button (Blue)**: Move up one lane + step forward
- **GO! Button (Green)**: Step forward without changing lane
- **S Button (Red)**: Move down one lane + step forward

These controls are automatically shown on:
- Screens smaller than 768px
- Devices with touch capability (no hover support)

Desktop users can use:
- **W key**: Move up + step forward
- **S key**: Move down + step forward
- **Click/Touch on track**: Step forward

## Online Mode (Multiplayer)
The game now supports online multiplayer racing with up to 6 players:

### How to Play Online
1. Click **Online Mode** from the main menu
2. Enter your username
3. Select your car (AE86, GT-R, or BRZ)
4. Choose to **Host Race** or **Join Race**:
   - **Host Race**: Creates a lobby with a unique 6-character code to share
   - **Join Race**: Enter a lobby code to join an existing race

### Lobby Features
- Real-time player list updates
- Host can start the race when ready
- Up to 6 players per lobby
- Players see who's the host

### Racing
- All players race simultaneously with synchronized obstacles
- Real-time score and survival tracking
- When a player crashes, others continue until all crash
- Live status shows how many players are still alive

### Leaderboard
After all players crash, a leaderboard displays:
- Final rankings based on grids survived
- Survival time for each player
- Medal system (gold, silver, bronze for top 3)
- Option to return to lobby for another race

### Technical Details
- Uses WebSocket for real-time communication
- Deterministic trap generation with shared seed ensures fair gameplay
- Server manages lobby state and race synchronization

## Notes
- Tailwind CSS loaded from CDN (suitable for this static app)
- No build step required - all assets are inline or loaded from CDN

## GitHub Export Ready

This project is now configured for GitHub with:
- Comprehensive README.md for documentation
- Updated .gitignore excluding large video files (*.mp4)
- Clean project structure suitable for open source
- Python server for local/Replit hosting

## How to Push to GitHub

1. **Create a GitHub repository** at https://github.com/new

3. **In Replit terminal**, run:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git branch -M main
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Interactive Grid Game with video backgrounds"
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. **Add video files** to GitHub Releases (optional, for download)
