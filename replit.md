## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (CDN), Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python 3.11 HTTP Server
- **Hosting**: Replit (0.0.0.0:5000)

## Development Setup
The project uses a simple Python HTTP server to serve static files:
- Server binds to `0.0.0.0:5000` for Replit compatibility
- Cache-Control headers prevent caching issues during development
- Auto-restart enabled via workflow

## Running Locally
```bash
python3 server.py
```
The application will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:5000/`

## Deployment
Configured for Replit Autoscale deployment:
- Deployment Target: Autoscale (for simple stateless web apps)
- Run Command: `python3 server.py`
- Port: 5000

## Features
- Fully responsive mobile and desktop design
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Multiple game modes with different difficulty levels
- Score tracking and performance metrics
- Car selection system with vehicle specifications

## Mobile Controls (Grid Game)
The Grid Game features dedicated mobile touch controls that appear on mobile devices:
- **W Button (Blue)**: Move up one lane + step forward
- **GO! Button (Green)**: Step forward without changing lane
- **S Button (Red)**: Move down one lane + step forward

These controls are automatically shown on:
- Screens smaller than 768px
- Devices with touch capability (no hover support)

Desktop users can use:
- **W key**: Move up + step forward
- **S key**: Move down + step forward
- **Click/Touch on track**: Step forward

## Notes
- Tailwind CSS loaded from CDN (suitable for this static app)
- No build step required - all assets are inline or loaded from CDN

## GitHub Export Ready

This project is now configured for GitHub with:
- Comprehensive README.md for documentation
- Updated .gitignore excluding large video files (*.mp4)
- Clean project structure suitable for open source
- Python server for local/Replit hosting
